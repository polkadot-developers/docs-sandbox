                  <h1>Writing style guidelines</h1>
                
                <p>This guide focuses on best practices for writing technical documentation and on the style conventions to use when
developing documentation for Parity Technologies products and audiences.
The goal of this guide is to help members of the documentation team and any one interested in contributing to documentation
write material that is clear, concise, and consistent.</p>
<p>If you can't find the answer to a style, voice, or terminology question in this guide, consult the following resources:</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="general-guidance-for-writing-engaging-content">General guidance for writing engaging content</h2>
<p>There are three keys to writing content that engages the audience:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the <em>second person</em> point of view to directly address the reader.</li>
<li>Use an <em>active voice</em> and <em>present tense</em> whenever possible.</li>
<li>Use a <em>conversational tone</em> that is not too formal or too chummy.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="point-of-view">Point of view</h3>
<p>In most cases, address the reader directly. For tutorials, use either first person plural—we, us, our, ours—or second person point of view.
Because tutorials provide a more guided approach to a topic, using the first person plural is a more natural
and commonly-accepted practice than in other types of documentation.</p>
<p>Use the first person point of view sparingly and with intention. When overused, the first person narrative can
overwhelm the sense of a shared experience and obscure the reader’s journey.</p>
<p>Do not use “I” or “me” unless it appears in the text of a user interface element.</p>
<p>Do not use “we” to refer to Parity or the Substrate Developer Hub team. For example, if you are documenting a
recommended setting or practice, use “Parity Technologies recommends....” not “We recommend...”.</p>
<h3 id="passive-constructions">Passive constructions</h3>
<p>In spite of the axiom to never use the passive voice, there are situations where a passive sentence structure might be appropriate.
Don’t twist a sentence into knots just to avoid a passive construction. Passive voice does have its place, but be wary of using it.</p>
<p>When writing about software, it’s often tempting to describe what’s happening from the code point of view.
However, there’s almost always a human being with a goal or task to complete who is initiating the activity that the software is executing.
If you keep this human presence in mind, your writing will be more dynamic, easier to follow, and more interesting to read.</p>
<h3 id="contractions-and-conversational-tone">Contractions and conversational tone</h3>
<p>Contractions are generally acceptable because they give documentation a more natural conversational tone—at least for English speakers.
Be conscious of when and why you use contractions.</p>
<p>To keep the tone conversational but concise, adhere to the following common-sense guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use common, well-known words whenever possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t use flowery language or literary flourish words and phrases like “and so forth”, “albeit”, “heretofore”, or “thus”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try to be precise in word choice. For example:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t use “when”—implying eventuality and time—as interchangeable with “if”, which implies the possibility of something happening.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t use phrases that introduce ambiguity. For example, instead of “When the process completes...” use “After the process completes...”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think carefully about word choices like using “since” (implying a period of time) instead of “because” (implying cause and result) or using “once” (single occurrence) instead of “after” (each time).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid using dead language words and phrases even if they are generally accepted as English words in practice. For example:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of “i.e.”, use “that is” or rewrite the sentence to make the meaning clear without needing extra qualification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of “e.g.”, use “for example”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of “via”, use an appropriate English substitute such as “by”, “through”, or “using”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of “etc.”, use “and so on” or revise the content to make the term unnecessary. For example, revise to use such as or like followed by an example or two.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of “caveat”, use an appropriate English substitute such as “notice”, “caution”, or “warning”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid adding unnecessary words or phrases. For example:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of “In order to”, just use “to”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of “as well as”, just use “and”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of “and then”, just use “then”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid jargon, colloquialisms, and idiomatic phrases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid adverbs and subjective statements. For example, don’t use words and phrases that include easily, rapidly, simply, quickly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experienced developers who truly prefer to skip the tutorial...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can quickly test if this code is functioning as expected...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="headings">Headings</h2>
<p>All heading levels should use the following conventions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use sentence style case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use active, present tense verbs in headings wherever appropriate, especially in the context of tutorials and how-to guides.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Serve as a summary of the content they contain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid generic headings like overview and introduction, if possible. While generic heading can be conceptually useful, they add no value to the content or the navigational experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always contain content.
  A heading should never be immediately followed by another heading.
  As a best practice, avoid using headings strictly for navigation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="limit-heading-levels">Limit heading levels</h3>
<p>As a best practice, avoid building an information hierarchy with more than three heading levels.
Most content can be effectively organized using two internal heading levels, making it easier to navigate and scan for relevant topics.</p>
<h3 id="topic-titles">Topic titles</h3>
<p>Avoid using gerunds (verbs that end with -ing) in titles and headings.
Procedure titles and headings should answer the question: <em>What are you trying to do?</em> For example, if the answer to <em>What are you trying to do?</em>
is <em>I want to create an account</em>, the article heading should be <em>Create an account</em>.
In most cases, concept and reference topics are named with a noun phrase, such as <em>Event hooks</em>.</p>
<h2 id="lists">Lists</h2>
<p>Introduce lists with a heading, a sentence, or a fragment that ends with a colon.</p>
<p>Use <strong>numbered lists</strong> for processes and procedures that must be completed in sequential order. Use <strong>bulleted lists</strong> for items that don't need to appear in order.</p>
<p>Make all list items parallel in structure. For example, start each item in the list using a noun or a phrase that starts with a verb.</p>
<h3 id="bullets">Bullets</h3>
<p>Bullets are for unordered lists.
The order of items in a bulleted list can imply importance, but generally all list items are peers.</p>
<p>Each list item should start with a capital letter and end with a period unless all of the list items are
single words or short phrases of no more than four words.
Use parallel structure in phrasing the items in a list.
For example, each list item might start with a verb, noun, or gerund.</p>
<h3 id="numbered-steps">Numbered steps</h3>
<p>Only use numbered paragraphs for steps in procedures.
If a procedure has more than nine steps, always consider breaking it into subsections with headings. Ideally, each procedure or subtask should be three to six steps, not have nested sub-steps, and have minimal embedded paragraphs describing what happens—the result or outcome to expect—in an unnumbered paragraph following the step.</p>
<p>Don't combine different actions into one step except when two actions complete a task, such as "Enter the user name, then click <strong>Next</strong>."</p>
<h2 id="pronouns">Pronouns</h2>
<p>Use gender-neutral pronouns, like “they” whenever possible.
Generally, you can change any noun from singular to plural to have subject-verb-pronoun agreement and avoid the use of gender-specific pronouns like “he”, “him”, “his” or “she”, “her”, “hers”.</p>
<p>Be wary of impersonal and potentially ambiguous pronouns such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>all, another, any</li>
<li>each, either</li>
<li>few, many, neither, none,</li>
<li>one, other</li>
<li>same, several, some, such</li>
<li>that, them, these, those</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use any of these impersonal pronouns, be sure you answer “of what?”, “of which?”, or “as what?” in the sentence.</p>
<h2 id="terminology-and-usage-conventions">Terminology and usage conventions</h2>
<p>This section covers common terminology, style, and usage questions and recommended practices.</p>
<h3 id="above-and-below">Above and below</h3>
<p>Don't use <em>above</em> to mean <em>earlier</em> or as an adjective preceding a noun (<em>the above section</em>) or following a noun (<em>the code above</em>). Use a hyperlink, or use <em>previous</em>, <em>preceding</em>, or <em>earlier</em>.</p>
<p>Don't use <em>below</em> to mean <em>later</em> or as an adjective preceding a noun (<em>the below section</em>) or following a noun (<em>the code below</em>).
Use a hyperlink, or use <em>later</em> or <em>the following</em>.</p>
<p>For example:
Use the preceding code to display information about the database.
Use the following code to display information about the database.</p>
<h3 id="dates-and-numbers">Dates and numbers</h3>
<p>Use the DD Mon YYYY or DD Month YYYY format for dates.</p>
<p>In body text, spell out whole numbers from zero through nine.
Use numerals for 10 or greater.
Use commas in numbers with four or more digits.
Use <em>more than</em> instead of <em>over</em> (over is a spatial term).</p>
<h3 id="emphasis-and-admonitionments">Emphasis and admonitionments</h3>
<p>Use bold formatting for user interface elements that the user interacts with, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dialog titles</li>
<li>Field labels</li>
<li>Buttons labels</li>
<li>Options displayed in the user interface</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't use bold, italics, or underlining for emphasis. If there's text that requires more attention than the surrounding body,
consider isolating it as a standalone note or tip.</p>
<p><strong>Use admonishment components sparingly!</strong> They are generally disruptive to the reader’s experience. Ask yourself if it is really necessary to stop the reader’s forward progress by adding a Note, Caution, or Tip component.</p>
<h4 id="note">Note</h4>
<p>Indicates neutral or positive information that emphasizes or supplements important points of the main text.
A note supplies information that may apply only in special cases. Examples are memory limitations, equipment
configurations, or details that apply to specific versions of a program.</p>
<h4 id="tip">Tip</h4>
<p>Helps users apply the techniques and procedures described in the text to their specific needs.
A tip suggests alternative methods that may not be obvious and helps users understand the benefits and capabilities of the product.
A tip is not essential to the basic understanding of the text.</p>
<h4 id="caution">Caution</h4>
<p>Advises users that failure to take or avoid a specific action could result in loss of data.</p>
<h3 id="images">Images</h3>
<p>Diagrams and illustrations can help readers visualize and internalize complex ideas and processes.
So, use them liberally but with intention.
Images also help to break up long text flows, but they should always reinforce and reflect the text immediately preceding or immediately following the image.</p>
<p>If you include screenshots, only include the relevant parts of the screen and use callouts to highlight how what is captured in the image is relevant to the text.</p>
<p>Be wary of using diagrams or illustrations that include any information—visual or textual—that is likely to get stale.</p>
<h3 id="log-in-formats">Log in formats</h3>
<p>Most Linux distributions and macOS use log in to describe how a user initiates an interactive session. Windows uses log on.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use <em>log in</em> as two words with no hyphen when describing an action (verb usage).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use <em>login</em> as one word when used as a noun (rare but some platforms use login to mean user or an identity).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use <em>log-in</em> with a hyphen when modifying a noun (adjective usage).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="optional-steps">Optional steps</h3>
<p>Use (Optional) to the beginning of steps that are optional. For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open a new terminal.</li>
<li>Open the attributes file in a text editor.</li>
<li>(Optional) Add a custom field.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="best-practices-and-common-mistakes">Best practices and common mistakes</h2>
<p>This section highlights best practices and common mistakes to avoid.</p>
<h3 id="make-every-word-count">Make every word count</h3>
<p>Concise sentences are easier to read, comprehend, and translate.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use simple words with precise meanings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove words that don’t add substance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid using passive <em>to be</em> verbs like been and being.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid weak or vague verbs, such as <em>have</em>, <em>make</em>, and <em>do</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When in doubt, choose the simple word or phrase over a more formal or complex one. For example:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Use this</th>
<th>Not this</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>use</td>
<td>utilize, make use of</td>

<tr>

<tr>
<td>to</td>
<td>in order to, as a means to</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>also</td>
<td>in addition</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>connect</td>
<td>establish connectivity</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Whenever possible, choose words that have one clear meaning.
Omit unnecessary adverbs—words that describe how, when, or where. Unless they're important to the meaning of a statement, leave them out.</p>
<h3 id="be-consistent">Be consistent</h3>
<p>Use one term consistently to represent one concept. For example, if you use extrinsic, dispatchable, and transaction interchangeably or ambiguously, you’ll leave the reader confused and uncertain. If terminology changes, be prepared to root out old terminology.</p>
<p>If you use words that can be both nouns and verbs—for example, words like file, post, mark, screen, record, and report—use sentence structure and context to eliminate ambiguity.</p>
<h3 id="avoid-dangling-participles">Avoid dangling participles</h3>
<p>Participles are modifiers so they must have a noun to modify. A dangling participle is a participle that doesn’t have a noun to modify. If you misplace or leave out the word being modified, you’ll end up with a sentence that is difficult to understand, illogical, or ambiguous (though potentially amusing). Here are a few examples of sentences with dangling participles:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Looking around the yard, dandelions sprouted in every corner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Walking through the kitchen, the smoke alarm was going off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Driving like a maniac, the deer was hit and killed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can correct these sentences by bringing the participle phrase closer to the subject the phrase is intended to modify or changing the word order of the sentence to clarify who is doing what. You can also fix these types of problems by changing the tense or using the active voice. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Looking around the yard, I saw dandelions had sprouted in every corner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As I was walking through the kitchen, the smoke alarm was going off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Driving like a maniac, he hit a deer and killed it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dangling-prepositions">Dangling prepositions</h3>
<p>In modern English, it’s perfectly acceptable to end a sentence with a preposition. Don’t twist a sentence into knots just to avoid using a preposition at the end.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This is something you might be interested in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is an example you should pay attention to.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cross-reference-formats">Cross-reference formats</h3>
<p>Most cross-references should include information that clarifies what the reader can expect to be found in the referenced topic.</p>
<ul>
<li>For cross-references to topics in the Substrate documentation, use the following formats:</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about [task or concept], see [topic-title].</p>
<ul>
<li>For cross-references in a glossary entry to other glossary entries, use the following format:</li>
</ul>
<p>See [topic].</p>
<ul>
<li>For cross-references to external resources, use the title of the destination instead of the URL of the destination.</li>
</ul>
<p>Avoid using links to unnamed destinations. For example, don’t use links like click <u>here</u> or see <u>this article</u>.</p>
<h2 id="writing-concept-topics">Writing concept topics</h2>
<p>Concept topics answer “why?” and “what is…?” questions.
Use concept topics to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Explain abstract ideas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Introduce new terminology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offer analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide background information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of a concept topic is to help the reader understand the bigger picture, the key components of a system or architecture, relationships between components.</p>
<p>Concept topics tend to be relatively stable, requiring little, if any, ongoing maintenance.</p>
<p>At a minimum, a concept topic includes at least one heading and one or more body paragraphs. A concept topic can also include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One or more examples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two or more subsections, marked by subheadings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A list of related topics.</p>
</li>
</ul>
