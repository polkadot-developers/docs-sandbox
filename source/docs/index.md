# Welcome to Substrate 

The Substrate Developer Hub provides a centralized location for developer resources and documentation to serve the Substrate developer community.

The topics here are intended to help you learn what's possible when you build a Substrate blockchain and how Substrate can help you build a blockchain that best serves your specific project requirements or business model.

Before you start building, though, you want to make sure you are in the right place.

* In [Choosing a development platform](), you'll learn how developing on a traditional smart contract platform differs from developing with Substrate and why Substrate might—or might not—suit your project requirements and goals.

* [Blockchain basics](./blockchain-basics.md) provides context about the complexity associated with blockchain development and how Substrate simplifies the process by taking an approach that is modular, flexible, and interoperable.

* Topics in [Fundamentals](./fundamentals.md) explain many of the core principles of the Substrate development environment and the design decisions that influence how you develop applications to run on a Substrate-based blockchain.

After you digest the information in these introductory sections, you'll be ready to start designing, building, and testing your own custom blockchain solution.
