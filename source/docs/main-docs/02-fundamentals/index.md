The topics here are intended to help you learn what's possible when you build a Substrate blockchain and how Substrate can help you build a blockchain that best serves your specific project requirements or business model.

Before you start building, though, you want to make sure you are in the right place.

* [Blockchain basics](main-docs/02-fundamentals/blockchain-basics.md) provides context about the complexity associated with blockchain development and how Substrate simplifies the process by taking an approach that is modular, flexible, and interoperable.

* In [Choosing a development platform](main-docs/01-why-substrate/choose-a-dev-platform.md), you'll learn how developing on a traditional smart contract platform differs from developing with Substrate and why Substrate might—or might not—suit your project requirements and goals.

* [Anatomy of a node](main-docs/02-fundamentals/substrate-client.md) and [Runtime as the core of Substrate chains](main-docs/02-fundamentals/runtime.md) highlight key components of the Substrate node architecture and what you need to know about the Substrate runtime environment.

Other topics in Fundamentals explain many of the core principles of the Substrate development environment and the design decisions that influence how you develop a Substrate-based blockchain to best suit your project or application.

After you digest the information in these introductory sections, you'll be ready to start designing, building, and testing your own custom blockchain solution.

It probably needs to be a section, not a page.

- Substrate architecture

- Network architecture

  - Private solo chain
  - Private enterprise chain (permissioned?)
  - Parachain
  - Relay chain
  - Substrate as the foundation for Polkadot, Kusama, testnets

- Anatomy of a node (light client, full client)

- Inbound request pool (extrinsic, peer-to-peer induction, 

- Consensus (models, block authoring, selection, validation, finalization,life cycle of a message))

- Economics (incentives, safety of the network, guardrails)

- Governance 

- Software development (Rust, Wasm, frame and pallets, data storage, tech stack)
