## Front-end development

Need new content on this and link to tutorials(?)
Add substrate connect: https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-docs/issues/573.

## Blockchain-specific best practices

* write efficient code
* simple or complex functions
* minimize database reads/writes
* be mindful of constraints (processing time for computation, network bandwidth, storage, memory)

## Substrate-specific syntax / structures (macros?)

Old content: https://docs.substrate.io/v3/runtime/macros/ 

Need to curate examples from how-to guides or exisiting Substrate code.

Examples of good APIs
Examples of using extrinsics
Examples of using storage

## Cryptographic Keys 

Types of keys to launch, recommendations etc.

See: https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-docs/issues/539
