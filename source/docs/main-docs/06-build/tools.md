Developers building with Substrate can use a number of tools depending on where they are in their development cycle.
### Polkadot-JS

The [Polkadot-JS project](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/) is a collection of tools, interfaces, and libraries around Polkadot and Substrate.
While the project is named after "Polkadot", these tools, interfaces, and libraries are fully compatible with any Substrate based chain.

#### Polkadot-JS API

The API provides application developers the ability to query a node and interact with the Polkadot or Substrate chains using Javascript.
Go to [documentation](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api).

The Polkadot-JS API is a [library of interfaces](https://github.com/polkadot-js/api) for communicating with Polkadot and Substrate nodes.
