This _Quick start_ assumes that you are setting up a development environment for the first time and want to try out running a single blockchain client—called a node—on your local computer.

To keep things simple, you'll connect to the local node using a web browser and look up a balance for a predefined sample account. 

## Before you begin

Before you begin, verify the following:

- You have good internet connection and access to a shell terminal on your local computer.

- You are generally familiar with software development and using command-line interfaces.
