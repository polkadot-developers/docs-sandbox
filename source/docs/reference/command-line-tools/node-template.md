# node-template

The `node-template` program provides a working Substrate node with FRAME system pallets and a subset of additional pallets for working with common blockchain functional operations.`
With its baseline of functional pallets, the `node-template` serves as a starter kit for building your own blockchain and developing a custom runtime.
You can use the `node-template` program to perform the following tasks:

## Basic command usage

The basic syntax for running `node-template` commands is:

```
node-template [subcommand] [FLAGS] [OPTIONS]
```

Depending on the subcommand you specify, additional arguments, options, and flags might apply or be required. 
To view usage information for a specific `node-template` subcommand, specify the subcommand and the `--help` flag. 
For example, to see usage information for `node-template key`, you can run the following command:

```
node-template key --help
```

### Flags

You can use the following optional flags with the `node-template` command.

| Flag   | Description
| ------ | -----------
| `--alice`  | Adds the session keys for the predefined `Alice` account to the local keystore. This flag is equivalent to running the node using `--name alice --validator` as command-line options.
| `--allow-private-ipv4` | Allows the node to connect to private IPv4 addresses (as specified in [RFC1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918)). This flag is enabled by default if the chain specifications for the node is identified as `local` or you start the node in development mode with the `--dev` flag.
| `--bob` | Adds the session keys for the predefined `Bob` account to the local keystore. This flag is equivalent to running the node using `--name bob --validator` as command-line options.
| `--charlie` | Adds the session keys for the predefined `Charlie` account to the local keystore. This flag is equivalent to running the node using `--name charlie --validator` as command-line options.
| `--dave` | Adds the session keys for the predefined `Dave` account to the local keystore. This flag is equivalent to running the node using `--name dave --validator` as command-line options.
| `--dev` | Starts the node in development mode in a fresh state. No state is persisted if you run the node using this flag.
| `--disable-log-color` | Disables the use of color in log messages.
| `--disable-log-reloading` | Disables log filter updates and reloading. By default, dynamic log filtering is enabled. However, the feature can affect performance. If you start the node with this flag, the `system_addLogFilter` and `system_resetLogFilter` remote procedure calls have no effect.
| `--discover-local`| Enables peer discovery on local networks. By default, this flag is `true` if you start the node using the `--dev` flag or if the chain specification is `Local` or `Development` and `false` otherwise.
| `--eve` | Adds the session keys for the predefined `Eve` account to the local keystore. This flag is equivalent to running the node using `--name eve --validator` as command-line options.
| `--ferdie` | Adds the session keys for the predefined `Ferdie` account to the local keystore. This flag is equivalent to running the node using `--name ferdie --validator` as command-line options.
| `--force-authoring` | Enables block authoring even if the node is offline.
| `-h`, `--help` | Displays usage information.
| `--ipfs-server` | Joins the IPFS network and serve transactions over bitswap protocol
| `--kademlia-disjoint-query-paths` | Requires iterative Kademlia distributed hash table (DHT) queries to use disjointed paths. This option increases resiliency in the presence of potentially adversarial nodes. See the S/Kademlia paper for more information on the high level design as well as its security improvements.
| `--light` | Runs the node in light client mode (experimental).
| `--no-grandpa` | Disables the GRANDPA voter if the node is running as a validator mode.If the node is not running as a validator, the option disables the GRANDPA observer.
| `--no-mdns` | Disables mDNS discovery. By default, the network uses mDNS to discover other nodes on the local network. This option disables discovery and is automatically applied if you start the node using the `--dev` option.
| `--no-private-ipv4` | Prevents connecting to private IPv4 addresses (as specified in [RFC1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918)), unless the address was passed with the `--reserved-nodes` or `--bootnodes` option. This setting is enabled by default for chains that are marked as "live" in their chain specifications.
| `--no-prometheus` | Disables the exposure of a Prometheus endpoint for receiving metrics. By default, metrics are exported to a Prometheus endpoint.
| `--no-telemetry` | Disables connecting to the Substrate telemetry server. Telemetry is enabled for global chains by default.
| `--one` | Provides a shortcut for specifying `--name One --validator` to add session keys for `One` to the keystore.
| `--password-interactive` | Enables you to specify the password for connecting to the keystore interactively in the terminal shell.
| `--prometheus-external` | Exposes the Prometheus exporter on all interfaces. The default is local.
| `--reserved-only` | Specifies whether to only synchronize the chain with reserved nodes. This option also disables automatic peer discovery. TCP connections might still be established with non-reserved nodes. In particular, if you are a validator, your node might still connect to other validator nodes and collator nodes regardless of whether they are defined as reserved nodes.
| `--rpc-external` | Listens to all RPC interfaces. Default is local. Note: not all RPC methods are safe to be exposed publicly. Use an RPC proxy server to filter out dangerous methods. More details: <https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/wiki/Public-RPC>. Use `--unsafe-rpc-external` to suppress the warning if you understand the risks.
| `--storage-chain` | Enables storage chain mode. If you set this option, each transaction is stored separately in the transaction database column and is only referenced by hash in the block body column.
| `--tmp` | Runs a temporary node. This option creates a temporary directory to store the blockchain configuration. The temporary directory is automatically deleted when you stop the node. The directory is random per process execution. This directory is used as a base path that includes the node database, node key, and the keystore.
| `--two` | Provides a shortcut for specifying `--name Two --validator` to add session keys for `Two` to the keystore.
| `--unsafe-pruning` | Forces the node to start with unsafe pruning settings. When running as a validator, it is highly recommended to disable state pruning (that is, archive) which is the default. The node will refuse to start as a validator if pruning is enabled unless this option is set.
| `--unsafe-rpc-external` | Listens to all RPC interfaces. This option is the same as `--rpc-external`.
| `--unsafe-ws-external` | Listens to all Websocket interfaces. This option is the same as `--ws-external` but doesn't warn you about it.
| `--validator` | Starts the node with the authority role and enables it to actively participate in any consensus task that it can (for example, depending on availability of local keys).
| `-V`, `--version` | Displays version information.
| `--ws-external` | Listens to all Websocket interfaces. Default is local. Note: not all RPC methods are safe to be exposed publicly. Use an RPC proxy server to filter out dangerous methods. More details: <https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/wiki/Public-RPC>. Use `--unsafe-ws-external` to suppress the warning if you understand the risks.

            The human-readable name for this node.
            
            The node name will be reported to the telemetry server, if enabled.
        --node-key <KEY>                                         
            The secret key to use for libp2p networking.
            
            The value is a string that is parsed according to the choice of `--node-key-type` as follows:
            
            `ed25519`: The value is parsed as a hex-encoded Ed25519 32 byte secret key, i.e. 64 hex characters.
            
            The value of this option takes precedence over `--node-key-file`.
            
            WARNING: Secrets provided as command-line arguments are easily exposed. Use of this option should be limited
            to development and testing. To use an externally managed secret key, use `--node-key-file` instead.
        --node-key-file <FILE>
            The file from which to read the node's secret key to use for libp2p networking.
            
            The contents of the file are parsed according to the choice of `--node-key-type` as follows:
            
            `ed25519`: The file must contain an unencoded 32 byte or hex encoded Ed25519 secret key.
            
            If the file does not exist, it is created with a newly generated secret key of the chosen type.
        --node-key-type <TYPE>
            The type of secret key to use for libp2p networking.
            
            The secret key of the node is obtained as follows:
            
            * If the `--node-key` option is given, the value is parsed as a secret key according to the type. See the
            documentation for `--node-key`.
            
            * If the `--node-key-file` option is given, the secret key is read from the specified file. See the
            documentation for `--node-key-file`.
            
            * Otherwise, the secret key is read from a file with a predetermined, type-specific name from the chain-
            specific network config directory inside the base directory specified by `--base-dir`. If this file
            does not exist, it is created with a newly generated secret key of the chosen type.
            
            The node's secret key determines the corresponding public key and hence the node's peer ID in the context of
            libp2p. [default: Ed25519]  [possible values: Ed25519]
        --out-peers <COUNT>
            Specify the number of outgoing connections we're trying to maintain [default: 25]

            A comma-separated list of origins (protocol://domain or special `null` value). Value of `all` will disable
            origin validation. Default is to allow localhost and <https://polkadot.js.org> origins. When running in
            --dev mode the default is to allow all origins.
        --rpc-http-threads <COUNT>                               
            Size of the RPC HTTP server thread pool

        --rpc-max-payload <rpc-max-payload>
            Set the the maximum RPC payload size for both requests and responses (both http and ws), in megabytes.
            Default is 15MiB
        --rpc-methods <METHOD SET>
            RPC methods to expose.
            
            - `Unsafe`: Exposes every RPC method.
            - `Safe`: Exposes only a safe subset of RPC methods, denying unsafe RPC methods.
            - `Auto`: Acts as `Safe` if RPC is served externally, e.g. when `--{rpc,ws}-external` is
              passed, otherwise acts as `Unsafe`. [default: Auto]  [possible values: Auto, Safe,
            Unsafe]
        --rpc-port <PORT>                                        
            Specify HTTP RPC server TCP port

        --state-cache-size <Bytes>                               
            Specify the state cache size [default: 67108864]

        --sync <SYNC_MODE>

            The URL of the telemetry server to connect to.
            
            This flag can be passed multiple times as a means to specify multiple telemetry endpoints. Verbosity levels
            range from 0-9, with 0 denoting the least verbosity. Expected format is 'URL VERBOSITY', e.g. `--telemetry-
            url 'wss://foo/bar 0'`.
